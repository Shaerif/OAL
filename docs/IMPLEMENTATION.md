# 🛠️ Implementation Guide

This guide helps you implement the Open Attribution License (OAL) in your projects.

---

## 📋 Quick Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Add LICENSE file with full OAL text
- [ ] Add copyright notice to your files
- [ ] Include OAL badge in README
- [ ] Document attribution requirements for users
- [ ] Add attribution section to documentation

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Add the License File

Create a file named `LICENSE` (no extension) in your project root:

```bash
# Create LICENSE file
touch LICENSE
```

Copy the full OAL 1.0 text into this file. Replace `[YEAR]` and `[COPYRIGHT HOLDER]` with your information.

### Step 2: Add Copyright Headers

Add copyright notices to your source files:

**For code files:**
```python
# Copyright (c) 2026 [Your Name]
# Licensed under OAL 1.0
# See LICENSE file for details
```

**For media files:**
Include attribution in metadata or accompanying text file:
```text
Copyright (c) 2026 [Your Name]
Licensed under OAL 1.0
```

### Step 3: Update README.md

Add the OAL badge and attribution section:

```markdown
## License

[![License: OAL 1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-OAL%201.0-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

This project is licensed under the Open Attribution License 1.0.

## Attribution

When using this work, please include:
```
[Project Name] by [Your Name]
Copyright [Year] [Your Name]
Licensed under OAL 1.0
```
```

### Step 4: Document for Users

Create an ATTRIBUTION.md file explaining how users should attribute your work:

```markdown
# Using This Work

When you use this project, please include the following attribution:

[Standard attribution text for your project]
```

## 🎯 Project Type-Specific Guidelines

### Software Libraries

1. Include license in package metadata
2. Add to package.json, setup.py, or equivalent
3. Include in documentation
4. Add copyright headers to source files

**Example package.json:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-library",
  "license": "OAL-1.0",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/username/repo"
  }
}
```

### Web Applications

1. Add license link in footer
2. Include in Terms of Service
3. Add to About page
4. Document in README

**Example footer:**
```html
<footer>
  <p>Licensed under <a href="/LICENSE">OAL 1.0</a></p>
</footer>
```

### Media Collections

1. Include attribution file with each asset
2. Add metadata to files when possible
3. Create master attribution document
4. Include in distribution package

**Example attribution.txt:**
```text
Collection: My Photo Pack
Copyright: 2026 [Your Name]
License: OAL 1.0

Individual file attributions:
- photo1.jpg: [Attribution details]
- photo2.jpg: [Attribution details]
```

### Datasets

1. Include license in dataset documentation
2. Add to data dictionary
3. Include in API documentation
4. Add citation information

**Example DATASET.md:**
```markdown
# Dataset Name

## License

This dataset is licensed under OAL 1.0.

## Citation

When using this dataset, please cite:
```
[Your Name] (2026). Dataset Name. 
Licensed under OAL 1.0.
```
```

## 🤖 AI-Generated Content

If your project includes AI-generated content:

1. **Identify AI Content**: Clearly mark which parts are AI-generated
2. **Document Tools**: State which AI tools were used
3. **Human Review**: Document human review and modifications
4. **Attribution Chain**: Attribute both original work and AI tools

**Example documentation:**
```markdown
## AI Content Notice

This project includes AI-generated content:

- Code generation: Assisted by [AI Tool Name]
- Image creation: Generated by [AI Tool Name]
- All AI output reviewed and modified by human contributors

Original training data and base models attributed per OAL 1.0 requirements.
```

## 🔄 Version Management

When updating your project:

1. **Update copyright year** when making significant changes
2. **Document changes** in CHANGELOG.md
3. **Keep license consistent** across all versions
4. **Notify users** of license updates if applicable
